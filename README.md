# `printf("Hello There!");`


My name is Dario Simpson, AKA Darius Barbus. I'm passionate about technology and creating stuff to help people, I have worked as a video editor for more than 7 years, but, it's time for a change. I'm leaving my home country to study software  engineering and turning my passion into an actual skill that can help people and businesses.
